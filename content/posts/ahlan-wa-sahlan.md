“Ahlan wa sahlan!” (أهلاً وسهلاً) is a common Arabic greeting that means **“Welcome!”** or **“You are warmly welcome!”**.

* **Ahlan** literally means “family” or “people,” implying “You are like family.”
* **Sahlan** means “easy” or “smooth,” implying “May your stay be easy and comfortable.”

So together, it’s a friendly way of saying **“You are among friends, and we wish you an easy, pleasant time.”** It’s often used to warmly welcome someone.
